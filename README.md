# 🤖 AI Chatbot with External Search (Cloud + ExaSearch)

This project is an intelligent AI-powered chatbot that integrates with external search services using **Cloud APIs** and **ExaSearch** to deliver accurate, real-time information based on user queries. It is designed to simulate human-like conversation while also enhancing responses with live search capabilities.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for understanding user input
- **External search integration** using ExaSearch for real-time data
- **Cloud-based architecture** for scalability and performance
- Easy-to-use **chat interface**
- Modular and extensible design for future enhancements

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **FastAPI / Flask** (for backend API)
- **ExaSearch API** (external search)
- **Cloud services** (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- **LangChain** (for chaining responses, optional)
- **Frontend** (HTML/CSS or React – depending on your setup)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user submits a question through the chatbot UI.
2. The system processes the query using an NLP engine.
3. If additional information is needed, it queries ExaSearch via API.
4. The final response combines AI-generated output with real-time search results.
5. The chatbot returns a rich, informative answer to the user.
